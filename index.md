## Welcome to DrydenArt's GitHub

This is my first time using Pages in GitHub!


### Resources I've Found Helpful:

1. I've found [CS Awesome](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//csawesome/index.html) to be an extremely helpful resource.
2. The [GeeksforGeeks]([https://github.com/DrydenArt/nycscertweb/edit/gh-pages/index.md](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)) site is a nice companion to use with CS Awesome.
3. There are lots of other resources, but it's Friday....
