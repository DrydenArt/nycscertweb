## Welcome to DrydenArt's GitHub

Hi, I'm Elizabeth Rechtin and this is my first time using Pages in GitHub!

### Summer Courses at Hunter College
[Click here](Courses.md) to see what I've been up to this summer!

### Resources I've Found Helpful:

1. I've found [CS Awesome](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//csawesome/index.html) to be an extremely helpful resource.
2. The [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) site is a nice companion to use with CS Awesome.
3. There are lots of other resources, but it's Friday....
